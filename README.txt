This program runs Conway's Game Of Life utilizing pthreads to split the task of processing. The game board is divided up between threads by rows, and when there are more threads than rows, individual rows are divided up between threads as well. This was done mainly for simplicity code-wise, since it means contiguous memory per thread as the board is stored as a single array in row-major order. Other approaches such as a tile based method may divide the board more evenly, but this method is fairly even as well so long as you don't have more threads than rows (which if you do, then you probably have too many threads to begin with or you have a board that consists of few long rows).
